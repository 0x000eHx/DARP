# DARP: Divide Areas Algorithm for Optimal Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning

This is a fork of the https://github.com/alice-st/DARP DARP-Algorithm python project.

Look up the original project for further details, how the algorithm works and all links.

## Example area division and pathfinding

* start_point 1 (17, 1) - 40% map area (portion 0.4)
* start_point 2 (5, 28) - 30%
* start_point 3 (27, 21) - 30%

Effective number of tiles: 722

Final assignment matrix (228 iterations, tiles per robot [289. 217. 216.])

## Important Changes
I recommend using an IDE like PyCharm to work with this python program.

My main script **darpinPoly.py** works without input/arguments.

You can change the path of a picture to whatever you like (more maps to play with inside _test_maps_)
The pictures of maps to analyze need transparent pixels as obstacles. All other pixels count as tiles to use for area calculation and pathfinding. The picture size is restricted too (look into **Visualization.py**)

Change the portions sizes (and trigger **not_equal_portions**) and robot **start_points** in **darpinPoly** and change triggers like **importance** to play around with the results.

## Dependencies
The same as the original project:

* Python version >= 3.6.14 (I'm working with Python 3.9.9)
* OpenCV version >= 4.5.2.54
* Pygame version >= 2.0.1
* Scipy version >= 1.7.1
* Pillow

To apply my working dependencies use pipenv.

## Installation and Running

* clone repo
* to get all dependencies install pipenv via pip
* `pipenv install`
* change some values or the map (described above) and run **darpinPoly.py**
* have fun

## ToDo
- [x] fix DARP 
- [x] get rid of the element-wise matrix manipulation loops by using numpy
- [ ] increase visualisation screen size or output resolution to be dynamic for bigger maps
- [ ] future features
