# DARP: Divide Areas Algorithm for Optimal Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning

## Motivation

This project deals with the path planning problem of a team of mobile robots, in order to cover an area of interest, with prior-defined obstacles.

DARP algorithm divides the terrain into a number of equal areas each corresponding to a specific robot, so as to guarantee complete coverage, non-backtracking solution, minimum coverage path, while at the same time does not need any preparatory stage.

## Requirements

Project is created with:

*Python version: 3.6.14
*OpenCV version: 4.5.2.54
*Pygame version: 2.0.1
